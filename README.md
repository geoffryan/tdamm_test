*TDAMM Models - Prototype*

An experiment to implement a common interface to a variety of theoretical models electromagnetic emission models relevant to Time Domain and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. Work began at the MOSSAIC 2023 Workshop at GWU.

**Considerations**

An electromagnetic emission model is a procedure for computing the spectral flux density $F_Î½$.
